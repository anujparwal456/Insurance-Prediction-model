# 🩺 Insurance Prediction Model

A **Machine Learning-based web application** that predicts medical insurance charges based on a person’s profile (age, BMI, smoking status, etc.) and classifies whether the insurance claim is likely to be approved or not.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning** can be used in the **health insurance domain** to:
1. Predict insurance costs based on user attributes (Regression)
2. Classify whether an insurance claim is likely to be approved (Classification)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a predictive model to estimate insurance charges.
- Develop a classification model for approval prediction.
- Deploy the project as an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.
- Visualize data insights and model performance metrics.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Used a dataset containing features like `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, and `region`.  
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation heatmap, distribution plots, and outlier analysis.  
   - Feature scaling for numerical attributes.

3. **Model Building**  
   - **Regression:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor  
   - **Classification:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier  
   - Evaluated models using R² score, accuracy, and confusion matrix.

4. **Deployment**  
   - Built a user interface with **Streamlit** for real-time predictions.  
   - Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.
